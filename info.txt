The game has to be exactly like ASCII ADOM. It has to have a big map.

You will be able to move around with WASD. And each map is made with 3x3 blocks. Blocks will have a type and each type has their own properties.

NPCs can come in the blocks. Blocks have people in them.

I gotta make it so there is a starting area, and that is one file. Consists of 3x3 blocks.
